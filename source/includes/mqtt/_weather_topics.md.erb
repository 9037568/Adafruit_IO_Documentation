# Weather Topics (IO+)

With access to weather data powered by Dark Sky, you can get hyper-local forecasts sent directly to your devices. Weather data is updated at most once every 20 minutes.

When you have an IO Plus account, you can track the weather through our HTTP or MQTT APIs for up to 5 locations at a time.

Prior to subscribing to the weather topic, you'll need to [generate the topics](https://io.adafruit.com/services/weather) to get the id.

## Subscribe to the Generated Topic

* `{username}/integration/weather/{id}/{type}`

 Where :id is the ID of the weather record you want data for and :type is the kind of forecast data you want. Valid types are:

* current
* forecast_minutes_5
* forecast_minutes_30
* forecast_hours_1
* forecast_hours_2
* forecast_hours_6
* forecast_hours_24
* forecast_days_1
* forecast_days_2
* forecast_days_5

MQTT weather subscriptions will publish updated data once per minute to every client that is subscribed to a valid topic.
