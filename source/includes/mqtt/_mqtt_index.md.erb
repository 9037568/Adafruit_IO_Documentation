# Adafruit IO MQTT API

[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), or message queue telemetry transport, is a protocol for device communication that Adafruit IO supports. Using a MQTT library or client you can publish and subscribe to a feed to send and receive feed data.

If you aren't familiar with MQTT check out this [introduction from the HiveMQ blog](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials-part-1-introducing-mqtt/). 
All of the subsequent posts in the [MQTT essentials series](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials-wrap-up/) are great and worth reading too.


## Client Libraries


To use the MQTT API that Adafruit IO exposes you'll need a MQTT client library.  For Python, Ruby, and Arduino you can use Adafruit's
IO libraries as they include support for MQTT. For other languages or platforms look for a MQTT library that ideally supports the MQTT 3.1.1 protocol.

* **Arduino**: [Adafruit MQTT](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library)

* **Python**: [Adafruit IO Python](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Python) includes an MQTT Client.

* **CircuitPython**: Accessing the Adafruit IO MQTT API is not currently supported on this platform.

* **MicroPython**: MicroPython devices can connect to Adafruit IO using [uMQTT](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/master/umqtt.simple)

* **Ruby**: [Adafruit IO Ruby](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-ruby) includes an MQTT client.

## Adafruit IO MQTT Connection Details

We *strongly* recommend connecting using SSL (Port 8883) if your client allows it.

|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Host**             | io.adafruit.com           |
| **Secure (SSL) Port**| 8883                      |
| **Insecure Port**    | 1883                      |
| **Username**         | Your Adafruit IO Username |
| **Password**         | Your Adafruit IO Key      |

_Need to manually set a Client ID for your MQTT client?_ Use a unique value such as a [random GUID](https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx).
