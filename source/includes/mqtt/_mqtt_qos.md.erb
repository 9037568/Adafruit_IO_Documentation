# MQTT QoS

One feature of MQTT is the ability to specify a QoS, or quality of service, level when publishing feed data.  This allows an application to confirm that its data has been sucessfully published.

If you aren't familiar with MQTT QoS levels [be sure to read this great blog post](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials-part-6-mqtt-quality-of-service-levels/) explaining their meaning.

For publishing feed values **the Adafruit IO MQTT API supports QoS level 0 (at most once) and 1 (at least once) only**.  

QoS level 2 (exactly once) is _not_ currently supported.

# MQTT API Rate Limiting

Adafruit IO's MQTT server imposes a rate limit to prevent excessive load on the service.  If a user performs too many publish actions in a short period of time then some of the publish requests might be rejected. 
The current rate limit is at most 1 request per second (or 60 requests within 60 seconds), without an Adafruit IO+ Boost applied to your account.

If you exceed this limit, a notice will be sent to the `(username)/throttle` topic. You can subscribe to the topic if you wish to know when the Adafruit IO rate limit has been exceeded for your user account.

This limit applies to all connections so if you have multiple devices or clients publishing data be sure to delay their updates enough that the total rate is below 2 requests/second.
