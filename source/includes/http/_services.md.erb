# Services

Adafruit IO provides access to several connected services. The current services offered are [IFTTT](https://io.adafruit.com/services/ifttt), [Zapier](https://io.adafruit.com/services/zapier), [Weather](https://io.adafruit.com/services/weather), [Randomizer](https://io.adafruit.com/services/words) and [Time](https://io.adafruit.com/services/time).

Each of these services is unique in that you may need to do some setup at the links above prior to utilizing the service via the Adafruit IO HTTP API.

## Time

The Adafruit IO time service does not replace a time-synchronization service like NTP, but it can help you figure out your local time on an Internet of Things device that doesn't have a built in clock.

Detailed documentation on the usage of the time API is found within [Adafruit IO on the time services page](https://io.adafruit.com/services/time).

## Randomizer

Create random data streams that can generate colors, words, numbers, or pick a value from a custom data set and send it directly to your devices.

The four available data types are:

* Pronounceable nonsense words
* Colors (RGB values, HSL values, CSS hex, or CSS color name)
* Numbers
* Preset (sample from a given set of values)

Detailed documentation on the usage and setup of the randomizer API is found within [Adafruit IO on the randomizer services page](https://io.adafruit.com/services/words).

## Weather

With access to weather data powered by Dark Sky, you can get hyper-local forecasts sent directly to your devices. Weather data is updated at most once every 20 minutes.

When you have an IO Plus account, you can track the weather through our HTTP or MQTT APIs for up to 5 locations at a time.

Detailed documentation on the usage and setup of the weather API is found within [Adafruit IO on the weather services page](https://io.adafruit.com/services/weather).
