# Client Libraries
We have lots of client libraries to help you get started with your project: 

* [Arduino C++](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Arduino)

* [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO/)

* [Python](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Python)

* [Ruby](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-ruby)

Note: The following two libraries use V1 of the Adafruit API which have been [depreciated](https://io.adafruit.com/api/docs/). 

* [Node.js](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-io-node-client)

* [Go](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-go)

They're all open source, so if they don't already do what you want, you can fork them and add any feature you'd like.
